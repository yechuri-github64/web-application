# web-application

Deploy a simple web application on AWS that demonstrates your understanding of cloud infrastructure, networking, and basic DevOps practices.

### Key design highlights:
1. Multi-AZ architecture
2. Public and private subnet separation
3. Secure access using security groups
4. Outbound internet access via NAT Gateway
